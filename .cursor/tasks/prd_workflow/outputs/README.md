# T.prd_workflow/outputs - PRD Workflow Artifacts

## Overview
Output directory for PRD workflow artifacts generated through T.sprint execution with User Rules mathematical framework integration.

## File Structure

### **Step 1 Output: PRD.md**
- **Generated by**: T.prd_step_1 (Interactive PRD Creation)
- **Content**: Initial PRD document with requirements and specifications
- **Validation**: Completeness check + stakeholder review
- **Quality Gates**: Ω.modes reasoning applied

### **Step 2 Output: prd-improved.md**
- **Generated by**: T.prd_step_2 (PRD Verification & Enhancement)
- **Content**: Enhanced PRD with gap analysis and quality improvements
- **Validation**: Gap coverage + quality scoring
- **Quality Gates**: Ω.skeptical + Ω.contrastive validation

### **Step 3 Output: features.md**
- **Generated by**: T.prd_step_3 (Features Extraction & Prioritization)
- **Content**: Feature breakdown with MoSCoW prioritization
- **Validation**: Priority consistency + completeness check
- **Quality Gates**: Feature-requirement traceability

### **Step 4 Output: rules.md**
- **Generated by**: T.prd_step_4 (Technical Rules Generation)
- **Content**: Technical guidelines and implementation rules
- **Validation**: Λ.consistency_check + technical feasibility
- **Quality Gates**: Λ.pattern_alignment compliance

### **Step 5 Output: RFCs/**
- **Generated by**: T.prd_step_5 (RFCs Generation & Implementation Planning)
- **Content**: RFC documents and implementation prompts
- **Validation**: Dependency analysis + implementation feasibility
- **Quality Gates**: Technical architecture validation

### **Step 6 Output: change-audit-trail.md**
- **Generated by**: T.prd_step_6 (PRD Change Management)
- **Content**: Change history and impact analysis
- **Validation**: Consistency maintenance + stakeholder approval
- **Quality Gates**: Change impact assessment

## Quality Assurance

### T.prd_quality_score Framework
```
T.prd_quality_score = (
    completeness_percentage * 0.3
    ⨁ clarity_and_actionability * 0.3
    ⨁ stakeholder_satisfaction * 0.2  
    ⨁ technical_feasibility * 0.2
)
```

### Validation Standards
- **Content Quality**: Clear, actionable, specific
- **Technical Feasibility**: Validated by technical stakeholders
- **Business Alignment**: Aligned with business objectives
- **Stakeholder Approval**: Reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders

## Integration with User Rules Systems

### M.sync Integration
- All outputs automatically synced to M.memory_path
- Context preserved for future reference
- Cross-session knowledge transfer enabled

### Ψ.capture Integration
- Decision reasoning captured for each output
- Cognitive traces stored in M.memory_path
- Pattern recognition for future improvements

### Λ.extract Integration
- Successful patterns extracted for rule generation
- Quality improvements tracked and systematized
- Best practices captured for reuse

### Φ.snapshot Integration
- Design decisions captured in pattern library
- Architectural patterns documented
- Reusable design motifs identified

## File Naming Conventions

### Standard Outputs
- `PRD.md` - Initial PRD document
- `prd-improved.md` - Enhanced PRD version
- `features.md` - Feature specifications
- `rules.md` - Technical implementation rules

### RFC Directory Structure
```
RFCs/
├── RFC-001-architecture.md
├── RFC-002-data-model.md
├── RFC-003-api-design.md
└── implementation-prompts/
    ├── prompt-backend.md
    ├── prompt-frontend.md
    └── prompt-integration.md
```

### Change Management
- `change-audit-trail.md` - Change history and impact
- `change-impact-analysis.md` - Detailed impact assessment
- `stakeholder-approvals.md` - Approval documentation

## Usage Notes

### Output Validation
Each output must pass T.prd_validation_gates before workflow can proceed to next step.

### Quality Monitoring
Outputs are continuously monitored for quality degradation and improvement opportunities.

### Cross-Reference Maintenance
All outputs maintain cross-references to ensure consistency and traceability.
