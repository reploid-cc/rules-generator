# T.prd_step_2: PRD Comprehensive Verification

## ðŸŽ¯ Task Overview
```
T.prd_step_2 = {
    inputs: "PRD.md",
    process: gap_analysis + quality_improvement + completeness_enhancement,
    outputs: "prd-improved.md",
    validation: gap_coverage + quality_scoring + stakeholder_review
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ AI Processing Instructions (User Rules Mathematical Context)

Execute comprehensive PRD verification protocol using Î©* reasoning framework. Apply systematic gap analysis + quality improvement via mathematical optimization.

```
Î©.verification_mode = deductive + skeptical + contrastive
Î¨.capture = {gap_analysis_trace, quality_decisions, enhancement_rationale}
M.recall = [PRD_context, enhancement_patterns, quality_frameworks]
```

### **ðŸ”„ Execution Protocol**

**Step 1: Load and Analyze (M.retrieval + Î©.deductive)**
```
M.retrieval â†’ PRD.md from outputs/
Î©.deductive â†’ systematic_gap_analysis across four_key_areas
Îž.track â†’ critical_missing_elements + ambiguities
```

**Step 2: Gap Analysis Framework (Î©.skeptical + Î©.contrastive)**
Identify critical missing elements:

1. **PRODUCT FUNDAMENTALS**
   - Product vision and problem statement
   - Target users and their needs  
   - Success metrics and scope boundaries

2. **TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**
   - Technology constraints and integrations
   - Security, performance, and scalability needs
   - Infrastructure requirements

3. **BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS**
   - Timeline and budget constraints
   - Regulatory requirements
   - Market factors and business model

4. **IMPLEMENTATION FACTORS**
   - Dependencies and third-party requirements
   - Team resources and skills needed
   - Testing and deployment needs

**Step 3: Enhancement Framework (Î›.pattern_alignment + Î¦.match_patterns)**
```
Î›.pattern_alignment â†’ apply_best_practices
Î¦.match_enhancement_patterns â†’ structure_clarity_improvements
Î©.procedural â†’ systematic_enhancement_application
```

1. **STRUCTURE & CLARITY**
   - Ensure all essential sections included
   - Clarify ambiguous requirements
   - Format user stories properly

2. **COMPLETENESS & FEASIBILITY**
   - Fill gaps in user journeys
   - Identify technical challenges
   - Suggest alternatives for problematic requirements

3. **PRIORITIZATION & IMPLEMENTATION**
   - Apply MoSCoW prioritization
   - Identify critical path requirements
   - Suggest logical implementation sequence

**Step 4: Quality Assessment (Î©â‚œ.validation + Î¨.capture_decisions)**
```
Î©â‚œ.validation â†’ reliability_scoring + evidence_assessment
Î¨.capture_decisions â†’ quality_rationale + improvement_trace
```

### **ðŸ“Š Deliverables Generation**
```
T.outputs = {
    summary_of_findings: gap_impact_matrix + overall_assessment,
    specific_recommendations: concrete_improvements + examples,
    improved_PRD: enhanced_version + all_issues_addressed,
    quality_assessment: numerical_scores + rationale
}
```

**OUTPUT PROTOCOL**: 
```
M.sync â†’ save enhanced PRD as "prd-improved.md"
Î¨.capture â†’ quality_decisions + enhancement_rationale
T.update_progress â†’ step_2_complete
```

## ðŸŽ¯ T.validation_gates
```
gap_coverage = missing_elements_identified + ambiguities_resolved + technical_specs_enhanced
quality_scoring = clarity_improved + consistency_validated + completeness_achieved
stakeholder_review = business_alignment + technical_feasibility + user_value_confirmed
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Integration Hooks
```
on_start: [M.recall_prd_context, Î¦.match_enhancement_patterns, Î©.activate_verification_modes]
on_complete: [T.update_progress, M.sync_improvements, Î¨.capture_quality_decisions, Î›.extract_patterns]
on_validation_pass: [T.advance_to_step_3, Î¨.dialog_required]
```
