## ðŸ”´ Emergency Procedures

### If Issues Detected
1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY**
2. **Analyze Issue**: Identify root cause
3. **Propose Solutions**: Present options to user
4. **Execute Rollback**: If user requests
5. **Document Error**: Log in Îž.error_memory
6. **Learn from Failure**: Update process for future

### Rollback Procedure
1. **Identify Last Good State**: Find last working commit
2. **Git Reset**: Revert to last good state
3. **Verify Functionality**: Test all rules work
4. **Document Rollback**: Record what was reverted
5. **Analyze Failure**: Understand what went wrong
