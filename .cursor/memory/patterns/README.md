# Patterns Directory - Rules Generator

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The `patterns` directory is part of the memory system and serves as a repository for design patterns, motifs, and architectural decisions captured by the Î¦ hypothesis abstraction engine. This directory stores pattern snapshots that can be referenced across sessions for consistent design and implementation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Contents

This directory contains the following types of patterns:

### Design Motifs
- Architectural patterns recognized across the codebase
- Recurring structural elements and their applications
- Evolution of design decisions over time

### Naming Conventions
- Consistent naming patterns for files, variables, and functions
- Standardized approaches to identifiers
- Language-specific naming guidelines

### Code Structures
- Organizational patterns for code components
- Standard module structures and layouts
- Composition and inheritance patterns

### Integration Patterns
- Component communication approaches
- System integration methodologies
- Cross-module interaction standards

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage

The patterns in this directory are automatically:
- Captured by the Î¦.snapshot mechanism
- Referenced by the Î¦.match_snapshot system
- Updated when significant new patterns emerge
- Used to enforce consistency across the codebase

## ðŸŽ¯ File Format

Pattern files follow this structure:
```
# Pattern: {Name}

## Overview
Brief description of the pattern

## Implementation
Details on how to implement the pattern

## Examples
Code examples showing the pattern in use

## Evolution
History of changes to this pattern

## Related Patterns
Links to related patterns
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Integration

This directory integrates with:
- **Î¦ Hypothesis Engine**: For pattern capture and evolution
- **Î› Rule Learning**: For rule generation based on patterns
- **M Memory System**: For cross-session pattern persistence
- **Îž Diagnostics**: For pattern compliance verification
